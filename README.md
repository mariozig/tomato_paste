Tomato Paste is a very basic Pomodoro timer and it's pretty much a literal implementation of the technique's "Underlying principles" as described on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#Underlying_principles).

Tomato Paste's Pomodoro cycle is as follows:

* Prompts you to title the task you plan to complete
* Start a timer for 25 minutes
* Once the main timer is done a visual and audio notification fires
* A short-break timer is started for 5 minutes
* Notifications fire once the break is over
* You're asked if you wish to do another Pomodoro
* After 4 Pomodori have been completed, a 20 minute break is enforced
* Loop!

## Installation

Easy!

    $ gem install tomato_paste

## Usage

After installing the gem just run `tomatopaste` from a terminal.
